However, multi-period portfolio optimization requires multistage return forecasts. Classical methods usually follow a two-stage framework: machine learning algorithms are employed to produce forecasts that closely fit the realized returns, and the predicted values are then used in a downstream portfolio optimization problem to determine the asset weights. This separation leads to a fundamental misalignment between predictions and decision outcomes, while also ignoring the impact of transaction costs. To bridge this gap, recent studies have proposed the idea of end-to-end learning, integrating the two stages into a single pipeline. This paper introduces IPMO (Integrated Prediction and Multi-period Portfolio Optimization), a model for multi-period mean-variance portfolio optimization with turnover penalties. The predictor generates multi-period return forecasts that parameterize a differentiable convex optimization layer, which in turn drives learning via portfolio performance. For scalability, we introduce a mirror-descent fixed-point (MDFP) differentiation scheme that avoids factorizing the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) systems, which thus yields stable implicit gradients and nearly scale-insensitive runtime as the decision horizon grows. In experiments with real market data and two representative time-series prediction models, the IPMO method consistently outperforms the two-stage benchmarks in risk-adjusted performance net of transaction costs and achieves more coherent allocation paths. Our results show that integrating machine learning prediction with optimization in the multi-period setting improves financial outcomes and remains computationally tractable. "

Recent work shows that regularized estimators and shrinkage techniques can significantly reduce estimation risk and stabilize return and covariance forecasts, leading to more robust portfolios in high-dimensional settings [24, 25]. Advancements in end-to-end, decisionfocused learning provide novel frameworks to integrate these two stages in modeling. Elmachtoub and Grigas [16] develop the Smart “Predict, then Optimize” framework, which replaces standard statistical losses with a decision-aware objective that directly penalizes the suboptimality of the downstream linear program induced by prediction errors. They show that training with the decision-centric loss can yield models that exhibit lower predictive accuracy yet deliver better decision performance than those trained under conventional decoupled approaches. However, solving the integrated optimization problems is computationally non-trivial in general. In multi-period settings, the number of decision variables in the optimization layer grows linearly with the planning horizon, posing challenges to the scalability of the integrated methods. Widely used differentiable optimization methods such as OptNet [2] and CvxpyLayer [1] rely on differentiating through large KKT systems. As the planning horizon increases, the associated KKT systems grow rapidly in dimension, substantially inflating training time. "

Instead of treating return prediction as an independent statistical task, the proposed framework incorporates the intertemporal structure of trading decisions and captures the effects of transaction costs. In empirical tests on real market data, the IPMO framework consistently delivers higher risk-adjusted performance, lower sensitivity to transaction costs, and more stable allocation paths both in sample and out of sample. These gains are robust across planning horizons and forecasting architectures. In addition, to overcome computational limitations, we develop a mirror descent fixed-point (MDFP) differentiation algorithm that applies a single mirror descent step at the optimal solution to obtain a fixed-point equation. This algorithm circumvents the construction and inversion of large KKT matrices, substantially reducing training time in practice. Our contributions are as follows: "

These frameworks maximize the risk-return trade-off under different metrics and constraints by selecting asset weights. In most empirical studies, the optimal portfolio is re-estimated periodically as the parameters change over time [20, 11, 26]. Nonetheless, it is shown that the greedy single-period optimization may lead to suboptimal solutions over the long run [15]. Gˆarleanu and Pedersen [18] show that in the presence of transaction costs, the optimal strategy is to gradually rebalance towards a weighted average of the current target portfolio and the expected future target portfolios, highlighting the necessity of multi-stage planning.

Building on the classical stochastic programming formulation [14], subsequent work optimizes expected terminal wealth or the utility of terminal performance over the investment horizon [41]. However, such objectives lead to timeinconsistent decisions, as the allocation may not remain optimal as time progresses [29]. Instead of applying a static pre-commitment strategy, later studies further examine multi-period mean-variance optimization in a dynamic setting [4]. Yu and Chang [40] fit a neural network to produce multi-period returns from simulation of economic factors. The return predictions are passed into a Mean-CVaR optimizer to obtain portfolio weights. Building on the model predictive control (MPC) formulation [10], several studies adopt related “predict-then-optimize” schemes for multi-period allocation [36, 30], where forecasts of returns and risks are passed into a deterministic optimization layer at each rebalancing date. On the other hand, some studies rely on sophisticated methods such as deep reinforcement learning without an explicit optimization process to generate portfolio weights directly [13, 21]. Motivated by the limitations of both pipelines, a complementary direction makes the optimizer part of the learning model, so that forecasts are shaped directly by the portfolio objective. "

Amos and Kolter [2] introduce OptNet to embed quadratic programs as neural layers via implicit differentiation of the KKT system, and Agrawal et al. [1] generalize this capability to disciplined convex programs through CvxpyLayer. Blondel et al. [8] present a general method of applying automatic implicit differentiation for a broad range of optimization problems. More recent studies further improve the computational tractability of large-scale end-to-end learning. BPQP [37] simplifies the backward pass as a QP and adopts efficient solvers for the forward and the backward passes separately. This decoupling provides greater flexibility in selecting solvers and accelerates the optimization process. dQP [32] computes the active constraint set to prune the KKT system, reducing computation costs for large-scale sparse problems. Building on these tools, finance studies move the portfolio optimization objective inside the learning loop in diverse settings. Lee et al. [27] study how decision-focused learning reshapes return predictors to improve decision quality, and complementary end-to-end GMV results are reported by Bongiorno et al. [9]. Uysal et al. [38] optimize risk-budgeting objectives in an end-to-end manner, demonstrating significant out-of-sample performance gains from including the optimization layer over the model-free approach. Tail- and risk-sensitive variants have primarily been explored through distributionally robust, single-period end-to-end formulations [12]. For tradability, single-period cardinalityconstrained portfolios are trained in an integrated, predict-and-optimize fashion [3]. Collectively, these works establish single-period end-to-end portfolios as a rigorous testbed, and provide the building blocks for multi-period end-to-end formulations. "

In end-to-end optimization, it is well recognized that embedding a differentiable optimization layer into the portfolio model incurs additional computational cost [3], posing challenges to the scalability of the end-to-end optimization. Multi-period formulations further amplify the computational burden, with costs growing at least linearly in the horizon. Wahlberg et al. [39] apply ADMM for multi-period portfolio optimization problems with transaction costs and yield orders-of-magnitude speedups over generic solvers. "

Though computationally tractable, the separation of the forecasting and decision-making stages can lead to suboptimal portfolio choices. For instance, small forecast errors can lead to materially different portfolio choices, as demonstrated by the well-documented flaw in the Markowitz model [6]. In the multi-period setting, this problem is exacerbated by the difficulty of multi-period forecasting and the path dependence of the downstream optimization problem. Moreover, transaction costs are not considered in the forecasting stage. Frequent fluctuations in predictions can significantly diminish portfolio performance, especially when the benefits of rebalancing are largely offset by transaction costs. "

While theoretically exact, this approach requires solving large linear systems involving KKT matrices at every backward step, which incurs substantial computational and memory costs. Each gradient evaluation entails matrix factorizations whose complexity scales cubically with problem size, and storing intermediate solver states quickly becomes prohibitive in multi-stage or high-dimensional settings. As a result, KKT-based differentiation often dominates runtime and limits scalability in IPMO training. "

For RLinear, the two-stage model exhibits both higher peak values and stronger fluctuations, implying large and frequent reallocations among assets. In contrast, the IPMO model keeps TV within a consistently lower and narrower range, indicating smoother transitions and gradual, small-magnitude adjustments over time. For CNN-LSTM, both models achieve much lower overall TV levels, consistent with their concentrated and long-holding allocation patterns. Yet, the two-stage model still displays occasional surges in TV, suggesting abrupt switches, while the IPMO model’s TV remains organized around two discrete levels, approximately 0 and 0.105, corresponding to long stationary phases punctuated by short, well-defined rebalancing events. This discrete switching pattern signifies a highly organized low-frequency turnover regime. Overall, these results confirm that the IPMO model delivers more temporally stable and coherent allocation patterns across both predictor types. "

By aligning return forecasts with portfolio objectives under transaction costs, the model learns economically consistent signals rather than optimizing a purely statistical loss. Empirical results on real ETF data demonstrate that the IPMO models consistently outperform their two-stage counterparts across different prediction models and planning horizons. With the RLinear model, IPMO regularizes portfolio dynamics, yielding steadier adjustments and lower transaction intensity. With the CNN-LSTM model, it captures meaningful shifts in portfolio composition, enabling timely responses to changing regimes without excessive turnover. Across both settings, the IPMO framework produces coherent allocation trajectories, leading to higher post-fee Sharpe ratios and improved drawdown control. Algorithmically, the proposed MDFP layer enables efficient and scalable training without explicit KKT factorizations, maintaining near-constant runtime as the horizon grows. This makes IPMO readily applicable to realistic multi-period decision environments. "

The current MDFP formulation is developed under simplex constraints, where the mirror-descent geometry ensures a well-defined fixed point. Nevertheless, the underlying idea is more general: any optimization problem whose solution satisfies a stable fixed-point relation can, in principle, be embedded within the same IPMO differentiation paradigm. Future work may formalize this generalization and extend it to richer constraint structures. In addition, the empirical analysis focuses on a moderate-sized asset universe to facilitate interpretable comparisons of portfolio dynamics. Scaling the framework to larger universes would provide a more rigorous test of its robustness and offer insight into how the learned temporal structure evolves in high-dimensional decision spaces. Advancing these directions would further consolidate IPMO optimization as a general methodology for multi-period financial decision-making. "
