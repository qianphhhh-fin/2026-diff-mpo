        "text": "Multi-period portfolio optimization is essential for realistic portfolio management, as it accounts for transaction costs, path-dependent risks, and the intertemporal structure of trading decisions that single-period models cannot capture. However, multi-period portfolio optimization requires multistage return forecasts. Classical methods usually follow a two-stage framework: machine learning algorithms are employed to produce forecasts that closely fit the realized returns, and the predicted values are then used in a downstream portfolio optimization problem to determine the asset weights. This separation leads to a fundamental misalignment between predictions and decision outcomes, while also ignoring the impact of transaction costs. To bridge this gap, recent studies have proposed the idea of end-to-end learning, integrating the two stages into a single pipeline. This paper introduces IPMO (Integrated Prediction and Multi-period Portfolio Optimization), a model for multi-period mean-variance portfolio optimization with turnover penalties. The predictor generates multi-period return forecasts that parameterize a differentiable convex optimization layer, which in turn drives learning via portfolio performance. For scalability, we introduce a mirror-descent fixed-point (MDFP) differentiation scheme that avoids factorizing the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) systems, which thus yields stable implicit gradients and nearly scale-insensitive runtime as the decision horizon grows. In experiments with real market data and two representative time-series prediction models, the IPMO method consistently outperforms the two-stage benchmarks in risk-adjusted performance net of transaction costs and achieves more coherent allocation paths. Our results show that integrating machine learning prediction with optimization in the multi-period setting improves financial outcomes and remains computationally tractable. ",

Recent work shows that regularized estimators and shrinkage techniques can significantly reduce estimation risk and stabilize return and covariance forecasts, leading to more robust portfolios in high-dimensional settings [24, 25]. Advancements in end-to-end, decisionfocused learning provide novel frameworks to integrate these two stages in modeling. Elmachtoub and Grigas [16] develop the Smart “Predict, then Optimize” framework, which replaces standard statistical losses with a decision-aware objective that directly penalizes the suboptimality of the downstream linear program induced by prediction errors. They show that training with the decision-centric loss can yield models that exhibit lower predictive accuracy yet deliver better decision performance than those trained under conventional decoupled approaches. However, solving the integrated optimization problems is computationally non-trivial in general. In multi-period settings, the number of decision variables in the optimization layer grows linearly with the planning horizon, posing challenges to the scalability of the integrated methods. Widely used differentiable optimization methods such as OptNet [2] and CvxpyLayer [1] rely on differentiating through large KKT systems. As the planning horizon increases, the associated KKT systems grow rapidly in dimension, substantially inflating training time. ",

Building on the classical stochastic programming formulation [14], subsequent work optimizes expected terminal wealth or the utility of terminal performance over the investment horizon [41]. However, such objectives lead to timeinconsistent decisions, as the allocation may not remain optimal as time progresses [29]. Instead of applying a static pre-commitment strategy, later studies further examine multi-period mean-variance optimization in a dynamic setting [4]. Yu and Chang [40] fit a neural network to produce multi-period returns from simulation of economic factors. The return predictions are passed into a Mean-CVaR optimizer to obtain portfolio weights. Building on the model predictive control (MPC) formulation [10], several studies adopt related “predict-then-optimize” schemes for multi-period allocation [36, 30], where forecasts of returns and risks are passed into a deterministic optimization layer at each rebalancing date. On the other hand, some studies rely on sophisticated methods such as deep reinforcement learning without an explicit optimization process to generate portfolio weights directly [13, 21]. Motivated by the limitations of both pipelines, a complementary direction makes the optimizer part of the learning model, so that forecasts are shaped directly by the portfolio objective. ",

This decoupling provides greater flexibility in selecting solvers and accelerates the optimization process. dQP [32] computes the active constraint set to prune the KKT system, reducing computation costs for large-scale sparse problems. Building on these tools, finance studies move the portfolio optimization objective inside the learning loop in diverse settings. Lee et al.

For tradability, single-period cardinalityconstrained portfolios are trained in an integrated, predict-and-optimize fashion [3].

This bilevel formulation directly aligns the learning process with the downstream decision-making objective.

Training such a bilevel model requires propagating gradients from the evaluation loss back to the predictor parameters. The key difficulty lies in differentiating through the inner optimizer: the gradient of the outer loss with respect to $\\theta$ depends on the Jacobian of the solution $\\mathbf { z } _ { t } ^ { * } ( \\theta )$ . For convex programs with simplex constraints and turnover penalties, computing this Jacobian analytically is intractable. Existing differentiable optimization frameworks, such as OptNet [2], CvxpyLayer [1], and BPQP [37], tackle this by applying the implicit-function theorem to the KKT system. While theoretically exact, this approach requires solving large linear systems involving KKT matrices at every backward step, which incurs substantial computational and memory costs. Each gradient evaluation entails matrix factorizations whose complexity scales cubically with problem size, and storing intermediate solver states quickly becomes prohibitive in multi-stage or high-dimensional settings. As a result, KKT-based differentiation often dominates runtime and limits scalability in IPMO training. ",

Concretely, the entropic mirror map yields a softmax-type multiplicative update at each stage, whose normalization operator implicitly enforces both the equality and nonnegativity constraints. As a result, the KKT multipliers never need to be formed explicitly and the sensitivity system decomposes into simple, stage-wise Jacobian-vector products. This fixed-point formulation avoids both explicit argmin differentiation and the unrolling of first-order solvers: the equilibrium allocation $\\mathbf { z } _ { t } ^ { * } ( \\theta )$ is characterized as the fixed point of the MD map, and differentiating through this relation yields efficient implicit gradients without constructing or factorizing the KKT matrix. Our approach therefore combines the geometric interpretability of mirror descent with the computational efficiency of fixed-point implicit differentiation, providing a scalable alternative to traditional KKT-based layers.

The CNN-LSTM model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 64 channels, a kernel size of 5, stride of 1, and the ReLU activation. The CNN output is passed into a max-pooling layer with a kernel size of 2. The Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model has two layers with a hidden dimension of 64 and generates the final predictions. Both neural networks incorporate reversible instance normalization to address the distribution shift problem [22]. The predictive models are trained to predict the returns for the next $H$ days using the past 120-day historical returns and are re-trained every 20 days using a look-back window of 250 days. To keep the estimation process simple, the covariance estimation follows a simple EWMA method, updated daily using the historical returns of the past 20 days. The portfolio is rebalanced daily. On each day, the model generates portfolio weights over the prediction horizon, but only the allocation for the next period is applied, following Boyd et al. [10]. The hyperparameters include the learning rate $\\gamma \\in \\{ 0 . 0 0 1 , 0 . 0 0 2 , 0 . 0 0 5 , 0 . 0 1 \\}$ , the turnover penalty $\\lambda \\in \\{ 0 . 0 0 0 1 , 0 . 0 0 0 5 , 0 . 0 0 1 , 0 . 0 0 5 , 0 . 0 1 \\}$ , and the planning horizon $H \\in \\{ 1 , 5 , 1 0 , 2 0 , 5 0 \\}$ . In addition, we tune the L2 regularizer for the linear model over the range $\\{ 0 , 0 . 0 0 0 1 , 0 . 0 0 1 \\}$ .

In contrast, the IPMO model keeps TV within a consistently lower and narrower range, indicating smoother transitions and gradual, small-magnitude adjustments over time. For CNN-LSTM, both models achieve much lower overall TV levels, consistent with their concentrated and long-holding allocation patterns. Yet, the two-stage model still displays occasional surges in TV, suggesting abrupt switches, while the IPMO model’s TV remains organized around two discrete levels, approximately 0 and 0.105, corresponding to long stationary phases punctuated by short, well-defined rebalancing events. This discrete switching pattern signifies a highly organized low-frequency turnover regime.

Across all configurations, the IPMO model consistently attains higher Sharpe ratios than the two-stage benchmark. For both the IPMO model and the twostage model, Sharpe ratios generally improve with longer horizons and reach their highest values when $H { = } 5 0$ . It is worth noting that when $H { = } 1$ , corresponding to a single-period formulation, all methods deliver their lowest Sharpe ratio. This degradation reflects the two limitations discussed earlier: the inability of a single-stage objective to internalize the intertemporal impact of transaction costs and the absence of multi-period coupling, which leads to inconsistent forecasts and conflicting signals. Examining model-specific patterns, the RLinear predictor displays a modest dip in Sharpe ratio around $H { = } 1 0$ , after which the gap shifts decisively in favor of the IPMO model. For the higher-capacity CNN-LSTM predictor, performance improves almost monotonically with $H$ , and the IPMO model maintains a clear lead throughout. The persistence of this gap across predictors indicates that the advantage of IPMO is robust. ",

For CNN-LSTM, the two-stage model shows the lowest and almost horizon-invariant MSE, suggesting that it has reached the accuracy limit achievable by the underlying architecture, which directly contributes to its performance improvement. In contrast, the IPMO model produces the largest MSE, and this discrepancy grows systematically with $H$ .

We also ran CNN-LSTM and observed qualitatively similar scaling, but omit it here for brevity. The problem size is controlled by the prediction horizon $H$ : increasing $H$ expands the optimization dimension, as every additional 10-step horizon introduces 70 new decision variables into the underlying arg min problem. For gradient computation, the MDFP layer adopts a Neumann-series approximation of the implicit Jacobian inverse, with the residual norm capped at $1 0 ^ { - 6 }$ to ensure stable and accurate differentiation while maintaining low computational overhead.

Among all methods, MDFP is the most size-insensitive: its runtime increases by only about 0.69 s from the smallest to the largest horizon, remaining nearly constant across the range. By contrast, BPQP scales almost linearly with the increasing horizon, which is competitive at small instances but quickly overtaken as $H$ grows, whereas CvxpyLayer exhibits the steepest growth. Accordingly, MDFP’s advantage widens with scale. It is worth noting that at the largest horizon, MDFP is about 3.29 $\\times$ faster than BPQP and 21.83 $\\times$ faster than CvxpyLayer. These findings further corroborate our theoretical rationale. CvxpyLayer’s reliance on large KKT factorizations and conic reformulations leads to poor scaling. BPQP still incurs horizon-coupled linear-system solves whose iteration burden grows with size.

By aligning return forecasts with portfolio objectives under transaction costs, the model learns economically consistent signals rather than optimizing a purely statistical loss. Empirical results on real ETF data demonstrate that the IPMO models consistently outperform their two-stage counterparts across different prediction models and planning horizons. With the RLinear model, IPMO regularizes portfolio dynamics, yielding steadier adjustments and lower transaction intensity. With the CNN-LSTM model, it captures meaningful shifts in portfolio composition, enabling timely responses to changing regimes without excessive turnover. Across both settings, the IPMO framework produces coherent allocation trajectories, leading to higher post-fee Sharpe ratios and improved drawdown control. Algorithmically, the proposed MDFP layer enables efficient and scalable training without explicit KKT factorizations, maintaining near-constant runtime as the horizon grows. This makes IPMO readily applicable to realistic multi-period decision environments. ",

The current MDFP formulation is developed under simplex constraints, where the mirror-descent geometry ensures a well-defined fixed point. Nevertheless, the underlying idea is more general: any optimization problem whose solution satisfies a stable fixed-point relation can, in principle, be embedded within the same IPMO differentiation paradigm. Future work may formalize this generalization and extend it to richer constraint structures. In addition, the empirical analysis focuses on a moderate-sized asset universe to facilitate interpretable comparisons of portfolio dynamics. Scaling the framework to larger universes would provide a more rigorous test of its robustness and offer insight into how the learned temporal structure evolves in high-dimensional decision spaces. Advancing these directions would further consolidate IPMO optimization as a general methodology for multi-period financial decision-making. ",
